    "La metodología **Lasso** o **L1** reduce la complejidad a través de la **eliminación de variables** (o _features_) que no aportan bastante al modelo. El modelo matemático que lo soporta es el siguiente:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\beta} = argmin \\sum^n_{i=1} \\left(y_i - \\beta _0 - \\sum ^p_{j=1} \\beta_j x_{ij}  \\right)^2 + \\lambda\\sum^p_{j=1} |\\beta_j| $$\n",

    "$$ \\hat{\\beta} = argmin \\sum^n_{i=1} \\left(y_i - \\beta _0 - \\sum ^p_{j=1} \\beta_j x_{ij}  \\right)^2 + \\lambda\\sum^p_{j=1} (\\beta_j)^2 $$\n",

    "El lambda ($\\lambda$) es el factor de penalización. A un mayor lambda, más fuerte penalizará a las variables y las reducirá en su importancia; a uno menor, menos fuerte será la penalización de las variables. En todo caso, el uso de la potencia hace que, recursivamente, las variables no sean canceladas.\n",

    "\n",
    "Se tiene un parámetro adicional $\\alpha$ ~ $[0, 1]$ que establece cuál es la importancia relativa de Lasso y Ridge dentro del modelo. En ese sentido, si $\\alpha = 0$, Elastic Net se comportará como Ridge. Si $\\alpha = 1$, se comportará como Lasso. Por tanto, **Elastic Net brinda todos los espectros lineales posibles de las combinaciones entre Lasso y Ridge**. \n",
